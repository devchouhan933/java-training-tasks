1.What does ORM stands for? Explain it briefly

Object-relational mapping (ORM) is use for  access and manipulate objects without
having to consider how those objects relate to their data sources. ORM lets programmers maintain a consistent view of
objects over time, even as the sources that deliver them, the sinks that receive them and the applications that access
them change.
ORM sets the mapping between the set of objects which are written in the preferred programming language like JavaScript
and relational database like SQL. It hides and encapsulates the SQL queries into objects and instead of SQL queries we
can use directly the objects to implement the SQL query.There are many different ORM frameworks that can be used with
different languages like Enterprise Java Beans(EJB), Hibernate, etc. can be used with Java.
