What is the difference between Hashmap and LinkedHashmap?

1. Order
     HashMap doesn't maintain any order while LinkedHashMap maintains the insertion order of elements in Java.

2. Memory Requirement
LinkedHashMap also requires more memory than HashMap because of this ordering feature. LinkedHashMap uses doubly LinkedList to keep the order of elements.
