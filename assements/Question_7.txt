What are the different Thread states in Java?
 1)NEW
        A thread that has not yet started is in this state.
2)RUNNABLE
        A thread executing in the Java virtual machine is in this state.
3)BLOCKED
        A thread that is blocked waiting for a monitor lock is in this state.
4)WAITING
        A thread that is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action is in this state.
5)TIMED_WAITING
            A thread that is waiting for another thread to perform an action for up to a specified waiting time is in this state.
6)TERMINATED
            A thread that has exited is in this state.

A thread can be in only one state at a given point in time.
